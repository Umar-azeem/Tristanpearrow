  {
    question: "What credit score do I need to buy a home?",
    answer:
      "Credit score requirements vary by loan program. Some options are available with lower scores, and others focus more on overall financial profile than a single number. We have solutions even for low score or no score borrowers, and resources to improve your score fast when needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you charge an origination fee?",
    answer:
      "In many cases, we do not charge any lender origination fee. Fees can vary depending on the loan program and scenario, but we're always transparent upfront so there are no surprises.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you a direct lender or a broker?",
    answer:
      "We combine the best of both worlds. We operate as a direct lender while offering the same loan programs and flexibility people associate with brokers. That means underwriting and processing are handled in-house, so you get better communication and faster decisions, without the layered broker points and fees that can come with some brokers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get approved if I'm self-employed or 1099?",
    answer:
      "Yes. There are loan programs designed for self-employed and 1099 borrowers that don't rely solely on traditional tax returns.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much do I need for a down payment?",
    answer:
      "Down payment requirements depend on the loan program. Some options allow for 0% down or low down payments, and we have assistance programs available for qualified buyers which in many cases eliminate the need for a downpayment.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the mortgage process usually take?",
    answer:
      "Most transactions take 2–4 weeks once under contract, though timelines can vary depending on the loan type and how quickly documentation is provided.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I've already been denied by another lender?",
    answer:
      "A denial doesn't always mean there are no options. Different lenders and programs have different guidelines, and a second look often changes the outcome. We never turn someone away just because they were denied elsewhere.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with investors as well as homeowners?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many investors trust us as a long-term financing partner. We have many loan programs that are ideal for investors.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use gift funds for my down payment?",
    answer:
      "Yes. In most cases, gift funds from family are allowed. We can help guide you in the best way to receive and use gift funds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with first-time homebuyers?",
    answer: "Yes, we have many options available for first time home buyers.",
  },
